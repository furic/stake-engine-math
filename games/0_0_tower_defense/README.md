# Tower Defense Game

## Summary:

* A 5-reel, 5-row, pays only connected symbol cluster (3 or more), no tumble nor cascading.
* 8 paying total (4 high, 4 low)
* 2 special symbols (wild, scatter)

Symbols payouts are grouped by cluster-sizes 3, 4, 5, ... 14, 15+.


## Base Game: 

The middle grid (3th reel 3th row) is a blocker and no symbol appears.

Minimum of 3 Scatter symbols needed for Bonus Game trigger.
8+ spins are awarded for Bonus Game.


## Bonus Game (Free Spins)
The middle grid becomes a wild and stay through the Bonus Game.

Every time a 5 high symbols (H1-H3) straight line appears (a full row or a full reel), increments the global multiplier by +1, which is persistent throughout the Bonus Game.

2 or more Scatters on award 2+ extra spins.

## Super Bonus Game 

Same as Bonus Game, but every time a 5 symbols straight line happens, it increments the global multiplier, then one of the symbol becomes a wild and stick thought the Super Bonus Game.

## Analysis Tools

### Core Analysis Scripts

#### `analyze_clustering.py`
**Purpose:** Analyzes clustering potential for each symbol in the reel configuration.
**Usage:** `python analyze_clustering.py`
**Description:** 
- Evaluates horizontal and vertical clustering opportunities
- Calculates clustering scores for each symbol (L1-L5)
- Identifies maximum cluster sizes and distribution patterns
- Essential for understanding why certain symbols have low win rates

#### `analyze_wins.py`
**Purpose:** Analyzes win distribution from the books JSON files.
**Usage:** `python analyze_wins.py [filename]`
**Description:**
- Parses books_base.json and books_bonus.json files
- Counts wins per symbol with detailed breakdown
- Shows cluster sizes and win amounts for L4/L5 symbols
- Provides percentage distribution of wins across all symbols
- Default analyzes `library/books/books_base.json`

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Analyze current reel clustering potential
python analyze_clustering.py

# Check win distribution after game run
python analyze_wins.py
```

### Game Configuration Status

**Current Paytable Hierarchy:**
