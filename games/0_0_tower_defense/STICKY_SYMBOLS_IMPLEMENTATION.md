# Tower Defense Game - Sticky Symbols Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds sticky symbols functionality to the tower defense game. M and H symbols created during free spins will now persist across all subsequent free spin reveals.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Added Sticky Symbol Methods in `game_executables.py`

- **`initialize_sticky_symbols()`**: Initializes tracking for sticky symbols
- **`add_sticky_symbol(symbol_name, position)`**: Adds a new sticky symbol to track
- **`replace_board_with_stickys()`**: Replaces board positions with sticky symbols before each reveal
- **`check_for_new_sticky_symbols()`**: Checks for new M/H symbols to make sticky

### 2. Modified `draw_board()` Method

The `draw_board()` method now:
- Calls the parent `draw_board()` method first
- Replaces board positions with sticky symbols during free spins
- Emits the reveal event

### 3. Modified `update_freespin()` Method

Now initializes sticky symbols tracking on the first free spin (when `self.fs == 0`).

### 4. Modified `get_clusters_update_wins()` Method

After generating upgrade events, it now checks for new sticky symbols during free spins.

### 5. Modified `generate_upgrade_events()` Method

Now places the upgraded symbol directly on the board and adds it to sticky symbols during free spins.

### 6. Modified `reset_fs_spin()` in `game_override.py`

Initializes sticky symbols tracking when entering free spins.

## How It Works

1. **Entering Free Spins**: When free spins are triggered, sticky symbols tracking is initialized
2. **Symbol Upgrades**: When L symbols form clusters and upgrade to M or H symbols, they are:
   - Placed on the board
   - Added to the sticky symbols list (during free spins only)
3. **Subsequent Reveals**: Before each new free spin reveal:
   - The board is drawn normally
   - Sticky symbols are then placed back on their original positions
4. **Persistent State**: M and H symbols maintain their positions throughout all free spins

## Data Structures

- **`sticky_symbols`**: List of dictionaries containing `{reel, row, symbol}`
- **`existing_sticky_positions`**: List of tuples `(reel, row)` for quick position lookup

## Expected Behavior

Looking at the provided JSON example:
- When M2 is created at position (1,0) in free spin 1, it should appear at that same position in all subsequent free spins
- When H2 is created at position (3,1) in free spin 2, it should appear at that same position in all subsequent free spins
- All M and H symbols should remain visible and consistent throughout the free spin sequence

This implementation ensures that M and H symbols act as "sticky" symbols that persist across free spin reveals, providing the expected game behavior.
